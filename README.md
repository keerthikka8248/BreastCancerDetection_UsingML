Features
Number of Features: 30 numerical features.
Feature Types: The features describe various attributes of cell nuclei, including:
Radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
Perimeter: Length of the cell nucleus's perimeter.
Area: Total number of pixels within the nucleus.
Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.
Compactness: (Perimeter^2 / Area) - 1.0.
Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the cell nucleus
